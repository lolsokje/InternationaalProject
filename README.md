## 4B - Body Temperature

### Android App

In this repository you can find all files related to the Baby Healthcare Assistence Module, and instructions how to use it.

The app can be installed in two ways:
1. Downloading the included .apk file on your phone, allow installation of apps from unknown locations (in my case settings -> security -> device administration -> unknown sources), and installing it by clicking on the apk file, or if that doesn't work;
2. Extract the BHAM folder from the archive, open it with Android Studio, connect your phone, and click the build button. Select ot run it on your phone, and it should install.

### API

Then run server.js

### Website

In the ZIP file are al the files of the website. Deploy the folder in your root folder of your server and it works.
